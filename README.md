argv0
=====

If you don't know what this is, you probably don't need it.  This is
essentially the same as djb's argv0 program, at

  http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/argv0.html

except that you don't need to build all of ucspi-tcp to use it.  (And I only
found out that djb wrote it after I did, of course.  In fact, I flipped around
the argument order to be compatible with his, so there.)
