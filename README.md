argv0
=====

argv0 runs a program with a specified 0th argument.

If you don't know what this is, you probably don't need it.  This is
essentially the same as [djb's argv0
program](http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/argv0.html), except that you don't need to
build all of ucspi-tcp to use it.  (And I only found out that djb wrote it
after I did, of course.  In fact, I flipped around the argument order to be
compatible with his, so there.)
